# Heart-Disease-Analysis

## We will be using the heart disease data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. After initial viewing of the data, we will clean it and handle missing values. We will then run some basic statistical tests and visualizations to decide what machine learning models to use. From there we will then implement classification trees, random forest, and logistic regression models.
